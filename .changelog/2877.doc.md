Document all Prometheus metrics produced by `oasis-node`

List of metrics with description and file location is available in
[docs/oasis-node/metrics.md](../docs/oasis-node/metrics.md) Markdown file. To
automate generation of this list, a new `// godoc: metric` rule was
introduced in Go to denote this variable as a Prometheus metric. A helper
script which extracts metrics information from Go code and produces the
resulting Markdown can be executed with `make docs`.
